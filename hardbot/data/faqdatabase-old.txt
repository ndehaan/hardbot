provoice:ProVoice is MA/Com's (formerly Ericsson) implementation of IMBE digital modulation for radio communications. It is not APCO-25 compliant, but does use the same IMBE vocoder developed by DVSI Inc. The technical difference between ProVoice and the APCO Project-25 standard is how error correction and modulation is provided to transmit the data.
trunking:A system that integrates multiple channel pairs into a single system. When a user wants to transmit a message, the trunked system automatically selects a currently unused channel pair and assigns it to the user, decreasing the probability of having to wait for a free channel for a given channel loading.

CNI:The Criminal Name Index is not a separate database but is actually a query type made against the CPIC database. It is the lowest level and the one with quickest response. It generally indicates the presence of a criminal history record, with a further more detailed query needed to pull more information.
CIIDS:The Computerized Integrated Information Dispatch System is the central dispatch organization system of the R.C.M.P. It integrates standard computer aided dispatch functions like messaging, incident logging, mapping with the ability to query the multitude of databases out there and interoperability with disparate radio systems.
ROADS:The Remote Office and Dispatch System is simply the mobile version of CIIDS. It allows remote access to many of the same application functions as a full CIIDS console. Amongst the most important data based queries, messaging, and mapping. Most access is via cellular networks via 1X,EVDO,etc.
PIRS:The Police Information Retrieval System is an investigative information recording and retrieval system containing detailed information on all events reported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and covers the entire organization. The database is commonly searched (By file number, address, name for example) for information on previous R.C.M.P. incidents.
PROS:The Police Reporting and Occurrence System is the replacement system for PIRS. It will integrate the existing databases of the R.C.M.P. with new data sources and puts in place much more advanced capabilities. Search, archiving, and security features have all been enhanced.
PRIME:The Police Records Information Management Environment is a real-time British Columbia specific real-time database system. It provides online access to law enforcement records, and is accessible by all provincial law enforcement agencies including the R.C.M.P. See http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/pia/prime_bc_e.htm

des:Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a widely-used method of data encryption using a private (secret) key that was judged so difficult to break by the US government that it was restricted for exportation to other countries. There are 72,000,000,000,000,000 (72 quadrillion) or more possible encryption keys that can be used. For each given message, the key is chosen at random from among this enormous number of keys. ...
aes:A symmetric 128-bit block cipher that has been adopted by the US Federal Government as its symmetric data encryption standard in October 2000, replacing the DES encryption it used. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the US Department of Commerce selected the algorithm, called Rijndael (pronounced Rhine Dahl or Rain Doll). The algorithm must be used with key sizes of 128 bits, 192 bits, or 256 bits depending on the applicatio

opensky:OpenSky is M/A-COM's implementation of AMBE digital modulation over a TDMA channel format. AMBE is another vocoder developed by DVSI Inc. Operation is very similar to Nextel TDMA digital voice systems. OpenSky systems do not use a control channel. Like ProVoice Open Sky cannot be monitored by any scanner, past or future.
tdma:Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) is a generic name for digital transmission formats that subdivide a channel into a fixed number of time slots during which digital data (usually encoded voice) is transmitted.

ctcss:In telecommunications, Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System or CTCSS is a circuit that is used to reduce the annoyance of listening to other users on a shared two-way radio communications channel. It is sometimes called tone squelch. Where more than one user group is on the same channel (called co-channel users), CTCSS filters out other users if they are using a different CTCSS tone or no CTCSS.

rank 1:Smouldering ground or creeping surface fire. This is a smouldering ground fire or a fire that burns in the ground fuel layer. These fires have no open flame and produce white smoke. Firebrands and going fires tend to be virtually self-extinguishing unless high DC and/or BUI values prevail, in which case extensive mop-up is generally required. 
rank 2:Low vigour surface fire. Rate of spread: less than 1.5m/min. This is a surface fire or a fire that burns in the surface fuel layer, excluding the crowns of trees. These fires produce visible open flame; have little or no spread, which is the speed at which the fire extends; and have an unorganized flame front or a flame front that does not exhibit all the same characteristics. 
rank 3:Moderately vigorous surface fire. Rate of spread: 1.5 - 3.0 m/min. This is a vigorous surface fire with a moderate rate of spread. They have an organized front and may display "candling", which is when a tree's fuels ignite and flare up, along the perimeter and/or within the fire. 
rank 4:Highly vigorous surface fire, torching (or passive crown fire). This type of fire produces grey to black smoke, has an organized surface flame front, and has a moderate to fast rate of spread along the ground. Short aerial bursts and short range spotting will occur with these fires. Control efforts at fire's head may fail. 
rank 5:Extremely vigourous surface fire or active crown fire. Rate of spread: 6.0 - 18.0 m/min.) This type of fire produces black to copper smoke, has an organized crown fire front, moderate to long-range spotting and independent spot fire growth. Very difficult to control. Suppression action must be restricted to fire's flanks. Indirect attack with aerial ignition (i.e., helitorch and/or aid dispenser) may be effective.
rank 6:Blow-up or conflagration, extreme fire behaviour. Rate of spread in excess of 18.0 m/min. Violent fire behaviour occurs with this type of fire. An organized crown fire front, moderate to long-range spotting and independent spot fire growth are characteristic of this fire type. There may be the presence of fireballs and whirls. Violent physical behaviour probable. Suppression actions should not be attempted until burning conditions ameliorat
